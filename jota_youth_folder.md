 To make a radio call, work through these steps in order. If you get stuck, then the operator will help you out.

 ## Call CQ

 Call the following on the radio " CQ CQ CQ , THIS IS { your callsign } CQ CQ CQ THIS IS { Your call sign phonetics}

 ## No reply?

 Call again

 ## Reply?

 Then quickly write down the calling callsign in the logging form attached and call them back!


## If they ask

MY QTH IS ____________________

My radio is a  _________________

## Logging

Now that you have made a contact, LOG IT! Your operator will be able to help, they will have a log running either in a notebook or digitally.

Remember that nothing is guaranteed with radio, and you may not get a reply, or may get many. Sometimes you'll be able to hear a station, but they won't be able to hear you. You just have to keep trying, and you'll get contact with someone eventually.

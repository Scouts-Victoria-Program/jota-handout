# What's a callsign?

Amateur radio operators use callsigns to uniquely distinguish themselves from each other. Each country has a pool of callsigns from which they can allocate.

A callsign is used rather than names because they are unique due to being issued by the government. They are also able to be used regardless of what language you speak.

In Australia, all callsigns you will hear during JOTA weekend will be of the following format

VK#XXX

Where VK is the prefix, this is the prefix all australian callsigns will use.

The "#" indicates a number, this will indicate the state that the callsign was issued in.

The "XXX" will either be two or three letter, being the operators unique callsign. These are sometimes randomly assigned, but are often picked out by the operator for a reason, IE their initials, or to indicate the name of a group or site.
